After a lot of time, a quit, a lot of crashes and an handle i finally decided to continue the project Carryhelper.

If you don't know what carryhelper was i would suggest looking at my other Thread, if you are lazy it was just a standalone jar that counted how many times a player needed a carry.

since i got some suggestions i decided to listed to the sb comunity and to create a Forge 1.8.9 mod implementing all the features.

CarryHelper
â€‹
Let me guess you make money carrying people in dungeons or eman.

If you are tired of using your brain to count how many times you have to carry a party this mod is the solution

You may ask how does it work
It's really simple, you type /carryhelper and this interface will pop up

Here you can add/remove players to carry.

What does Buttons do?
- Add: Add the player to the carry list
- Remove: Remove the player to the carry list
- Clear: Remove all the players from the carry list
- Lap: 
           - If Player Nickname textbox is not set:
                     Removes 1x carry from all the players
            - If Player Nickname textbox is set to a player carry
                     Remove 1x carry from the player
- Auto LAP: Toggles Auto Lap on/off

In the 2.0 update i added Auto LAP feature, looking for defeat boss message to auto lap the party (Currently not working for slayers)

You will probably ask should i trust this stranger and use this mod?
I think you shouldn't trust anyone not even me, i would suggest testing the mod on isthisarat or if you are an advanced user looking at the mod code and compile it yourself.

I would also let you know that this is my first mod so i would like getting more suggestion/help than hate, Hope this mod help you not get scammed
